/**
 *   Given the number of cannonballs on each side of the base, calculate the total number of cannonballs in the entire
 *   tetrahedral stack
 *
 *   Input: The first line contains "n", giving the number of tetrahedral problems posed, for a maximum of 100 problems.
 *      Following that are exactly "n" lines, each with a single number giving the number of cannonballs on each side
 *      of the base, a positive integer from 0 to 100, not inclusive.
 *   Output: The problem number, followed by a colon(:), a blank space, the number of cannonballs on each side of the
 *      base, another blank space, and the total number of cannonballs in the tetrahedron.
